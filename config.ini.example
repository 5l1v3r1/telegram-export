[TelegramAPI]

# You must edit these values to use the exporter
# You can either get your own from my.telegram.org
# Or use a published one:

# Either Whitelist or Blacklist should be present, not both.
# * Whitelist will backup only the usernames, phones or IDs listed.
# * Blacklist will backup everything but listed.
# Phones start with '+' (no quotes), and items separated by comma.
# It's usually  a good idea to set a whitelist, as otherwise you will have
# to wait for lots of dialogs you don't care about to be downloaded. You can
# get a list of dialogs and their associated IDs by running
# `telegram-export.py --list-dialogs`

[Downloader]

# The file types to download, comma separated. Options are:
# "photo", "document", "video", "audio", "sticker", "voice".
# An empty list (default if omitted) means all are allowed.
; MediaWhitelist = photo, sticker
MediaWhitelist = photo, sticker

# The maximum allowed file size for a document before skipping it.
# For instance, "800KB" will only download files smaller or equal to 800KB.
# Allowed units are "B", "KB", "MB" and "GB" (floating point allowed).
#
# No unit defaults to "MB". Setting to "0"  will not download any media.
# Note that this only applies to documents (everything but normal photos).
; MaxSize = 1MB
