# Leave as . to dump things in the folder with the script, or put an absolute path.

# Either Whitelist or Blacklist should be present, not both. If both are
# present, only Whitelist will be used.
# * Whitelist will backup only the usernames, phones or IDs listed.
# * Blacklist will backup everything but listed.
# Phones start with '+' (no quotes), and items separated by comma.
# It's usually  a good idea to set a whitelist, as otherwise you will have
# to wait for lots of dialogs you don't care about to be downloaded. You can
# get a list of dialogs and their associated IDs by running
# `telegram-export.py --list-dialogs`

############################# 'Advanced Options' #############################

# The file types to download, comma separated. Options are:
# "photo", "document", "video", "audio", "sticker", "voice", "chatphoto".
# An empty list (default if omitted) means all are allowed.
# Note that "chatphoto" includes profile pictures as well.
; MediaWhitelist = chatphoto, photo, sticker
MediaWhitelist = chatphoto, photo, sticker

# The maximum allowed file size for a document before skipping it.
# For instance, "800KB" will only download files smaller or equal to 800KB.
# Allowed units are "B", "KB", "MB" and "GB" (decimal point allowed).
#
# No unit defaults to "MB". Setting to "0"  will not download any media.
# Note that this only applies to documents (everything but normal photos).
; MaxSize = 1MB
MaxSize = 1MB

# Sets the log level used across the entire dumper. Supported values
# are the same available in the "logging" module. Defaults to DEBUG.
# Available levels (less to more verbose): ERROR, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG, NOTSET
; LogLevel = INFO

# Database filename (without '.db')
; DBFileName = export
DBFileName = export

# The format string to be used when downloading media. You can use any literal
# string you wish in the name, relative names (including directories, separated
# by the '/' character) or absolute paths. Anything inside {} will be replaced
# with a proper value, and possible placeholders are:
# {id}          - Message ID
# {sender_id}   - Sender ID
# {context_id}  - Context ID
# {name}        - Sanitized name of the context (chat)
# {filename}    - Sanitized name of the file
# {sender_name} - Sanitized sender name
# {type}        - The media type (e.g. photo, document, video...)
# {ext}         - The extension of the file (*including* the dot)
#
# For instance, you could do:
#   MediaFilenameFmt = "usermedia/{name}/{type}/{filename}{ext}"
#
# That would save files under "usermedia/Chat Name/media type/media file.ext".
# The extension will be added automatically if you forget it. Invalid format
# specifiers will be ignored and left blank.
#
# To format the date of the mesage, you can use the format specifiers
# described under the following link anywhere you wish:
# https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-behavior
# eg. for the year you would put %Y in the format string and for a literal %
# you would put %%, though that would be a bit weird.
#
# If the filenames are not unique, you may get files overwritten by other files!
# Some uniqueness tips: Context IDs won't be the same, Message IDs won't be
# repeated in the same context
